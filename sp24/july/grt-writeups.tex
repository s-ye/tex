This will be a comprehensive writeup of the topics from geometric representation theory which I have studied this year.
We will attempt to cover the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Borel-Weil-Bott theorem
    \item The solution of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture
    \item Affine Grassmannians
    \item The geometric Satake equivalence
\end{itemize}
In order to understand many of these results, we need to master many of the basic tools. This includes
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cohomology of algebraic varieties
    \item Derived categories
    \item The theory of perverse sheaves
    \item The theory of D-modules
    \item Intersection Cohomology
\end{itemize}
