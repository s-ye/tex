\today

Recently I have felt that there is a lot going on in parallel and that things must be organized
so that I understand what it is I need to work on. Therefore, in this month of July I will write down 
some of the things I understand about the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometric representation theory
    \item Toric symplectic manifolds and some of the papers I have read for Tara
    \item Embedded contact homology and knot homology for Yuri (perhaps?)
\end{itemize}
