\begin{problem}{1 (from RS1)}
$\Delta$ is the unit disk, $\Delta^\times = \Delta \setminus \{0\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that a holomorphic map $f:\Delta^\times \to \C$ which has an \emph{essential} (non–pole) singularity at $0$ has dense image in $\C$.
  \item Use this to show that any map $f:\Delta^\times \to \P$ which is never more than $N$-to-$1$, for a fixed number $N$, extends holomorphically to $\Delta$.
  \item Generalize (b) to the case when the target is an arbitrary compact Riemann surface $R$, by invoking Riemann’s theorem which guarantees the existence of meromorphic functions on $R$.
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Remark.} A much stronger (and more difficult) version of (a) says that $f$ assumes every value infinitely often, possibly with a single exception (such as $0$, for $e^{1/z}$). This is the Great Picard Theorem.

\begin{problem}{2}
Identify successive pairs of edges of a $2n$-gon, labelled $a,a,b,b,c,c,\dots$, by matching points on matching edge pairs in \emph{parametric order}. (Equivalently, identify the points $\theta$ and $\theta+\pi/n$ on the boundary of the unit disk.) 

Explain why the surface obtained is homeomorphic to the one obtained by sewing on $n$ M{\"o}bius strips to an $n$-holed sphere, along matching boundaries. 

Which of these gives a Klein bottle?

\emph{Remark.} It’s not hard to show that every closed non–orientable surface is obtained in this way, but please \emph{do not} write a complete proof of that \dots

\begin{problem}{3 (from RS2)}
Show that any degree $2$ holomorphic map $f:\C/L \to \P$ is a “M{\"o}bius transform of a shifted $\wp$–function’’:
\[
  f(u) = \frac{a\wp(u-w)+b}{c\wp(u-w)+d}, \qquad a,b,c,d,w \in \C.
\]
\emph{Comment.} You may assume standard facts about M{\"o}bius transformations.

\begin{problem}{4 (from RS2)}
Prove that any two meromorphic functions $f,g$ on a compact Riemann surface are \emph{algebraically related}: $P(f,g)\equiv 0$ for some $2$–variable polynomial $P$.

\emph{Hint.} Recall that a meromorphic function without poles must be constant, and estimate, in terms of $N$, the dimension of the vector space spanned by the functions $f^m g^n$, for $0\le m,n\le N$, to conclude that a linear dependence relation must hold for large $N$.

\begin{problem}{5}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Specializing the period lattice to the limiting case $\omega_1 = \pi$, $\omega_2 \to i\cdot\infty$, show that
  \[
    \wp(u) \to \cot^2(u) + \tfrac{2}{3}, \qquad
    \zeta(u) \to \cot(u)+u, \qquad
    \sigma(u) \to \sin(u)\cdot \exp(u^2/2).
  \]
  \item Do the series expansions apply?
  \item Find and check the differential equation expressing $(\wp')^2$ in terms of $\wp$ in this limit.
  \item Describe the (singular) analytic set in $\C^2$ parametrized as $z=\wp(u), w=\wp'(u)$.
\end{enumerate}
