\section{Preliminaries on GIT}
\subsection{Generalities on GIT quotients}
Let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety, and let $\widetilde{X} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ be the corresponding affine cone.
Since $X$ is the space of lines in $\widetilde{X}$, it has a tautological line bundle 
\[
\mathcal{O}_X(-1) = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-1)\big|_X
\]
over it whose fibre over a point in $X$ is the corresponding line in 
$\widetilde{X} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. The total space of $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$ therefore 
has a tautological map to $\widetilde{X}$ which is an isomorphism away from the zero section 
$X \subset \mathcal{O}_X(-1)$, which is all contracted down to the origin in $\widetilde{X}$. 
In fact the total space of $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$ is the \textbf{blow up} of $\widetilde{X}$ in the origin.

Linear functions on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ like $x_i$, restricted to $\widetilde{X}$ and pulled 
back to the total space of $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$, give functions which are linear on the fibres, 
so correspond to sections of the \textbf{dual} line bundle $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. Similarly degree $k$ 
homogeneous polynomials on $\widetilde{X}$ define functions on the total space of $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$ 
which are of degree $k$ on the fibres, and so give sections of the $k$th tensor power 
$\mathcal{O}_X(k)$ of the dual of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$.

So the grading that splits the functions on $\widetilde{X}$ into homogeneous degree 
(or $\mathbb{C}^*$-weight spaces) corresponds to sections of different line bundles $\mathcal{O}_X(k)$ 
on $X$. So
\[
\bigoplus_{k \ge 0} H^0(\mathcal{O}_X(k))
\]
considered a graded ring by tensoring sections 
$\mathcal{O}(k) \otimes \mathcal{O}(l) \cong \mathcal{O}(k+l)$. For the line bundle $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ 
sufficiently positive, this ring will be generated in degree one. It is often called the 
(homogeneous) coordinate ring of the \textbf{polarised} (i.e.~endowed with an ample line bundle) 
variety $(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$.

The degree one restriction is for convenience and can be dropped (by working with varieties 
in weighted projective spaces), or bypassed by replacing $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ by $\mathcal{O}_X(p)$, 
i.e.~using the ring
\[
R^{(p)} = \bigoplus_{k \ge 0} R_{kp}; \qquad \text{for $p \gg 0$ this will be generated by its degree one piece $R_p$.}
\]
The choice of generators of the ring is what gives the embedding in projective space. In fact 
the sections of any line bundle $L$ over $X$ define a (rational) map
\begin{equation} \label{eq:map}
X \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}\big(H^0(X,L)^*\big), 
\qquad 
x \mapsto ev_x, 
\quad 
ev_x(s) := s(x),
\end{equation}
which in coordinates maps $x$ to $(s_0(x):\cdots:s_n(x)) \in \mathbb{P}^n$, where $s_i$ form a basis for $H^0(L)$. This map is only defined for those $x$ with $ev_x \neq 0$, 
i.e.~for which $s(x)$ is not zero for every $s$. 

Now suppose we are in the following situation, of $G$ acting on a projective variety 
$X$ through $SL$ transformations of the projective space.
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
G \arrow[d] & \curvearrowright & X \arrow[d,hook] \\
SL(n+1,\mathbb{C}) & \curvearrowright & \mathbb{P}^n
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Since we have assumed that $G$ acts through $SL(n+1,\mathbb{C})$, the action lifts from $X$ to one covering it on $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$. In other words we don't just act on the projective space (and $X$ therein) 
but on the vector space overlying it (and the cone $\widetilde{X}$ on $X$ therein). This 
is called a \textbf{linearisation} of the action. Thus $G$ acts on each 
$H^0(\mathcal{O}_X(r))$.

Then, just as $(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ is determined by its graded ring of sections of 
$\mathcal{O}(r)$ (i.e.~the ring of functions on $\widetilde{X}$),
\[
(X,\mathcal{O}(1)) \;\longleftrightarrow\; \bigoplus_r H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))
\]
we simply \textbf{construct} $X/G$ (with a line bundle on it) from the ring of 
\textbf{invariant} sections:
\[
X/G \;\longleftrightarrow\; \bigoplus_r H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G
\]
This is sensible, since if there is a good quotient then functions on it pullback to give 
$G$-invariant functions on $X$, i.e.~functions constant on the orbits, the fibres of 
$X \to X/G$. For it to work we need:
\begin{lemma}
$\bigoplus_r H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G$ is finitely generated.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $R := \bigoplus_r H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))$ is Noetherian, Hilbert’s basis theorem tells 
us that the ideal $R\cdot \big(\bigoplus_{r>0} H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G\big)$ generated by 
$R^G_{+} := \bigoplus_{r>0} H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G$ is generated by a finite number of 
elements $s_0,\ldots,s_k \in R^G_{+}$.

Thus any element $s \in H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G$, $r>0$, may be written 
$s = \sum_{i=0}^k f_i s_i$ for some $f_i \in R$ of degree $<r$. To show that the $s_i$ 
generate $R^G_{+}$ as an algebra we must show that the $f_i$ can be taken to lie in $R^G$.

We now use the fact that $G$ is the complexification of the compact group $K$. Since 
$K$ has an invariant metric, we can average over it and use the facts that $s$ and $s_i$ 
are invariant to give
\[
s = \sum_{i=0}^k \operatorname{Av}(f_i)\, s_i,
\]
where $\operatorname{Av}(f_i)$ is the ($K$-invariant) $K$-average of $f_i$. By complex 
linearity $\operatorname{Av}(f_i)$ is also $G$-invariant (for instance, since $G$ has a 
polar decomposition $G = K \exp(i\mathfrak{t})$). The $\operatorname{Av}(f_i)$ are also of 
degree $<r$, and so we may assume, by an induction on $r$, that we have already shown that 
they are generated by the $s_i$ in $R^G_{+}$. Thus $s$ is also.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Projective GIT quotient]
Let $X$ be a projective variety with an action of a reductive group $G$ linearised by a line bundle $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. We define $X/G$ to be 
\[
\operatorname{Proj}\, \bigoplus_r H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G.
\]
\end{definition}
If $X$ is a variety (rather than a scheme) then so is $X/G$, as its graded ring sits inside 
that of $X$ and so has no zero divisors. 

\begin{definition}[Affine GIT quotient]
Let $X = \operatorname{Spec} R$ be an affine variety with an action of a reductive group $G$. We define the affine GIT quotient $X/G$ to be $\operatorname{Spec}(R^G)$, where $R^G$ is the ring of $G$-invariant regular functions on $X$.
\end{definition}
In some cases, this does not work so well. For instance, under the scalar action of 
$\mathbb{C}^*$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ the only invariant polynomials in 
$\mathbb{C}[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ are the constants and this recipe for the quotient gives a 
single point. In the language of the next section, this is because there are no stable 
points in this example, and all semistable orbits’ closures intersect (or equivalently, 
there is a unique polystable point, the origin). More generally in any affine case all 
points are always at least semistable (as the constants are always $G$-invariant functions) 
and so no orbits gets thrown away in making the quotient (though many may get identified 
with each other — those whose closures intersect which therefore cannot be separated 
by invariant functions). But for the scalar action of $\mathbb{C}^*$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ 
we clearly need to remove at least the origin to get a sensible quotient.

So we should change the linearisation, from the trivial linearisation to a nontrivial one, to get a bigger quotient. This is demonstrarted in the following example.

\begin{example}[Projective space as a GIT quotient]
    Consider the trivial line bundle on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ but with a nontrivial 
linearisation, by composing the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ by a character 
$\lambda \mapsto \lambda^{p}$ of $\mathbb{C}^*$ acting on the fibres of the trivial line 
bundle over $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. The invariant sections of this no longer form a ring; we 
have to take the direct sum of spaces of sections of \textbf{all powers} of this linearisation, 
just as in the projective case, and take $\operatorname{Proj}$ of the invariants of the 
resulting graded ring.

We calculate the invariant sections for general p. Look at the $k$-th tensor power of the linearised line bundle. Sections are homogeneous polynomials $f(x_0,\dots,x_n)$ of some degree. Under $\lambda$, such an $f$ transforms as
\[
f(x_0,\dots,x_n) \mapsto f(\lambda x_0,\dots,\lambda x_n) = \lambda^d f(x_0,\dots,x_n),
\]
where $d=\deg f$.

But the linearisation introduces an extra factor $\lambda^{-pk}$ when we act on the fibre of the $k$-th tensor power. By definition, the $G$-action on a section $s$ is
\[
(g\cdot s)(x) \;=\; g\cdot \big(s(g^{-1}\cdot x)\big).
\]
Take a polynomial $f$ homogeneous of degree $d$. View the section as
\[s(x) = f(x)\cdot e\]
where $e$ is a trivialising section of the fibre. When we apply the group action:
\[
(g\cdot s)(x) = g\cdot(f(g^{-1}\cdot x)\cdot e)
= \big(\lambda^{-d} f(x)\big)\cdot \lambda^{pk} e
= \lambda^{-d+pk)} f(x)\cdot e.
\]
For invariance, we need the weight to vanish, i.e.
\[
d = pk.
\]
So only polynomials of degree exactly $pk$ survive as invariants in the degree $k$ graded piece.

If $p<0$ then there are no invariant sections and the quotient is empty. We have seen that 
for $p=0$ the quotient is a single point. For $p>0$ the invariant sections of the $k$th 
power of the linearisation are the homogeneous polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^n$ of degree $kp$. 
So for $p=1$ we get the quotient
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{C}^{n+1}/\mathbb{C}^* 
= \operatorname{Proj} \bigoplus_{k\ge 0} \big(\mathbb{C}[x_0,\dots,x_n]_k\big) 
= \operatorname{Proj} \mathbb{C}[x_0,\dots,x_n] = \mathbb{P}^n.
\end{equation}
For $p\ge 1$ we get the same geometric quotient but with the line bundle 
$\mathcal{O}(p)$ on it instead of $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

Another way to derive this is to embed $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ as 
$x_{n+1}=1$, act by $\mathbb{C}^*$ on the latter by 
$\operatorname{diag}(\lambda,\dots,\lambda,\lambda^{-(n+1)}) \in SL(n+2,\mathbb{C})$, 
and do projective GIT. This gives, on restriction to $\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, 
the $p=n+1$ linearisation above. The invariant sections of $\mathcal{O}((n+2)k)$ are of the form 
$x_{n+1}^k f$, where $f$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $(n+1)k$ in $x_1,\dots,x_n$. 
Therefore the quotient is
\[
\operatorname{Proj} \bigoplus_{k\ge 0} 
\big(\mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{(n+1)k}\big) = \operatorname{Proj} \big(\mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n],\mathcal{O}(n+1)\big).
\]
\end{example}


\begin{definition}[Semistable points]
A point $x \in X$ is \textbf{semistable} iff there exists 
$s \in H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G$ with $r>0$ such that $s(x) \neq 0$. Points which are not
semistable are \textbf{unstable}.
\end{definition}
So semistable points are those that the $G$-invariant functions "see." The map \begin{align*}
    X^{ss} &\to \P(H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G)^* \\
    x &\mapsto ev_x
\end{align*} is well defined on the (Zariski open, though possibly empty) locus $X^{ss} \subseteq X$ of semistable points, and it is clearly constant on $G$-orbits, 
i.e.~it factors through the set-theoretic quotient $X^{ss}/G$. But it may contract more 
than just $G$-orbits, so we need another definition.

\begin{definition}[Stable points]
A semistable point $x$ is \textbf{stable} if and only if 
$\bigoplus_r H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(r))^G$ separates orbits near $x$ and the stabiliser of $x$ is finite.
\end{definition}




\subsection{Relevant example}
We recall the basic set-up of Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotients relevant to our situation.

Let $V = \mathbb{C}^4$ with coordinates $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2$ and consider the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action given by 
\[
t\cdot(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)=(t x_1, t x_2, t^{-1}y_1, t^{-1}y_2)
\]
We linearize this action by a character $\chi_m:t\mapsto t^m$ with $m\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. Since $V$ is affine, the GIT quotient for $\chi_m$ is $\mathrm{Proj}\,R^{(m)}$, where
\[
R^{(m)}=\bigoplus_{d\ge 0} \Gamma(V,\mathcal{O}_V)^{\mathbb{C}^*,\,\chi_m^{\otimes d}}=\bigoplus_{d\ge 0}\{\,f\in\mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2]\mid t\cdot f = t^{md} f\,\}
\]
In other words, $R^{(m)}_d$ is spanned by monomials whose total $\mathbb{C}^*$-weight is $md$, where the weight of a monomial $x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2}y_1^{b_1}y_2^{b_2}$ is $w=a_1+a_2-(b_1+b_2)$.

A point $v\in V$ is $\chi_m$-semistable iff there exists $d>0$ and $f\in R^{(m)}_d$ with $f(v)\ne 0$.

Here $R^{(m)}_d$ consists of polynomials whose monomials have positive weight $w=md>0$. Such a monomial must contain at least one $x$ (indeed, more $x$'s than $y$'s), so it vanishes at any point with $x_1=x_2=0$. Therefore no section in $R^{(m)}_d$ can be nonzero at a point with $x_1=x_2=0$ $\Rightarrow$ those points are unstable.

Conversely, if $(x_1,x_2)\neq(0,0)$, then pick $d$ and the monomial
$f=x_i^{md}$ with $x_i\neq 0$. It has weight $md$ and $f(v)\neq 0$, so $v$ is semistable.

Therefore, for $m>0$,
\[
V^{ss}(\chi_m)=V\setminus\{x_1=x_2=0\}.
\]
The quotient is $(V\setminus\{x_1=x_2=0\})/\mathbb{C}^*$, i.e. the total space of $\mathcal{O}(-1)^{\oplus 2}\to\mathbb{P}^1_{[x_1:x_2]}$. Similarly, for $m<0$, we have
\[
V^{ss}(\chi_m)=V\setminus\{y_1=y_2=0\}.
\]
The quotient is $(V\setminus\{y_1=y_2=0\})/\mathbb{C}^*$, i.e. the total space of $\mathcal{O}(-1)^{\oplus 2}\to\mathbb{P}^1_{[y_1:y_2]}$.

\subsection{Quotient stack}
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a category and $p:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{S}$ be a functor of categories. 
We visualize this data as
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{X} \arrow[d, "p"'] & a \arrow[r, "\alpha"] \arrow[d] & b \arrow[d] \\
\mathcal{S} & S \arrow[r, "f"'] & T
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where the lower case letters $a,b$ are objects of $\mathcal{X}$ and the upper case letters $S,T$ 
are objects of $\mathcal{S}$. We say that $a$ is over $S$ and that a morphism $\alpha: a\to b$ is 
over $f:S\to T$.

\begin{definition}[Prestacks]\label{def:prestacks}
A functor $p:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{S}$ is a \textbf{prestack over a category $\mathcal{S}$} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] (\textbf{pullbacks exist}) for every diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
a \arrow[d] \arrow[r, dashed] & b \arrow[d] \\
S \arrow[r] & T
\end{tikzcd}
\]
of solid arrows, there exists a morphism $a\to b$ over $S\to T$; and

\item[(2)] (\textbf{universal property for pullbacks}) for every diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
a \arrow[d] 
  \arrow[r, dashed] 
  \arrow[rr, bend left=15] & 
b \arrow[d] \arrow[r] & 
c \arrow[d] \\
R \arrow[r] & S \arrow[r] & T
\end{tikzcd}
\]
of solid arrows, there exists a unique arrow $a\to b$ over $R\to S$ filling in the diagram.
\end{enumerate}
Prestacks are also referred to as \textbf{categories fibered in groupoids}. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Fiber categories]\label{def:fibercat}
If $\mathcal{X}$ is a prestack over $\mathcal{S}$, the \textbf{fiber category} 
$\mathcal{X}(S)$ over $S\in\mathcal{S}$ is the category of objects in $\mathcal{X}$ over $S$ 
with morphisms over $\mathrm{id}_S$.
\end{definition}

Given an action of an algebraic group $G$ on a scheme $X$, the \textbf{quotient prestack} $[X/G]^{\mathrm{pre}}$ is the prestack whose fiber category 
$[X/G]^{\mathrm{pre}}(S)$ over a scheme $S$ is the quotient groupoid (or the moduli groupoid of orbits) $[X(S)/G(S)]$ 
This will not satisfy the gluing axioms of a stack; even when the action is free, 
the quotient functor $\mathrm{Sch} \to \mathrm{Sets}$ defined by $S \mapsto X(S)/G(S)$ is not a sheaf 
in general. Put another way, we define:
\begin{definition}[Quotient prestacks]
Let $G \to S$ be a smooth affine group scheme acting on a scheme $U$ over $S$. 
The \textbf{quotient prestack} $[U/G]^{\mathrm{pre}}$ of an action of a smooth affine group scheme $G \to S$ 
on an $S$-scheme $U$ is the category over $\mathrm{Sch}/S$ consisting of pairs $(T,u)$ where $T$ is an $S$-scheme 
and $u \in U(T)$. An element $g \in G(T')$ acts by $(T',u') \to (T,u)$ via the data of a map $f:T'\to T$ of 
$S$-schemes and an element $g \in G(T')$ such that $f^*u = g \cdot u'$. Note that the fiber category 
$[U(T)/G(T)]$ is identified with the quotient groupoid.
\end{definition}
It turns out that the stackification of $[U/G]^{\mathrm{pre}}$ is the quotient stack $[U/G]$, hence the name is justified.

\begin{definition}[Quotient stacks]
The \textbf{quotient stack} $[U/G]$ is the prestack over $\mathrm{Sch}/S$ consisting of diagrams
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
P \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & U \\
T
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where $P \to T$ is a principal $G$-bundle and $P \to U$ is a $G$-equivariant morphism of $S$-schemes. 

A morphism 
\[
(T' \;\longleftarrow\; P' \;\longrightarrow\; U) \;\longrightarrow\; 
(T \;\longleftarrow\; P \;\longrightarrow\; U)
\]
consists of a morphism $T' \to T$ and a $G$-equivariant morphism $P' \to P$ of schemes such that the diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
P' \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \arrow[rr, bend left=20] & 
P \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & 
U \\
T' \arrow[r] & T & 
\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
is commutative and the left square is cartesian.
\end{definition}

A stack over a site $\mathcal{S}$ is a prestack $\mathcal{X}$ where the objects and morphisms glue uniquely in the Grothendieck topology of $\mathcal{S}$.

\begin{definition}
    [Stack] \label{def:stack}
    A \textbf{stack} $\mathcal{X}$ over a site $\mathcal{C}$ is a prestack over $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying the following descent conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (Descent for morphisms) For any $U\in\mathcal{C}$, any covering $\{f_i:U_i\to U\}$, and any $x,y\in\mathcal{X}(U)$, the presheaf
    \[
    \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(x,y): (V\to U) \mapsto \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{X}(V)}(f^*x,f^*y)
    \]
    is a sheaf on $\mathcal{C}/U$.
    \item (Descent for objects) For any $U\in\mathcal{C}$, any covering $\{f_i:U_i\to U\}$, and any descent datum $(x_i,\phi_{ij})$ relative to $\{f_i:U_i\to U\}$, there exists an object $x\in\mathcal{X}(U)$ and isomorphisms $\psi_i:f_i^*x\xrightarrow{\sim} x_i$ such that $\phi_{ij}\circ f_j^*\psi_j = f_i^*\psi_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Substack]
    A \textbf{substack} $\mathcal{Y}\subseteq \mathcal{X}$ is given by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each $U\in\mathcal{C}$, a full subcategory $\mathcal{Y}(U)\subseteq \mathcal{X}(U)$.
    \item Stability under restriction:
    If $y\in \mathcal{Y}(U)$ and $f:V\to U$ is a morphism in the site, then the pullback $f^*y \in \mathcal{X}(V)$ must lie in $\mathcal{Y}(V)$.
    \item Stack condition:
    The collection $\mathcal{Y}$ is itself a stack (i.e. satisfies descent for objects and morphisms).
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open and closed substacks]\label{def:open-closed-substacks}
A substack $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ of a stack over $\mathrm{Sch}_{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}$ 
is called an \textbf{open substack} (resp.\ \textbf{closed substack}) if the inclusion 
$\mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{X}$ is representable by schemes and an open immersion (resp.\ closed immersion).
\end{definition}

\section{Introduction}
Let $V = \mathbb{C}^4$ with co-ordinates $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$, and let $\mathbb{C}^*$ act on $V$ with weight $1$ on each $x_i$ and weight $-1$ on each $y_i$. There are two possible GIT quotients $X_{+}$ and $X_{-}$, depending on whether we choose a positive or negative character of $\mathbb{C}^*$. Both are isomorphic to the total space of the bundle $\mathcal{O}(-1)^{\oplus 2}$ over $\mathbb{P}^1$.

Both are open substacks of the Artin quotient stack
\[
    \mathcal{X} = [V/\mathbb{C}^*]
\]
given by the semi-stable locus for either character. 
Let
\[
    \iota_{\pm} : X_{\pm} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{X}
\]
denote the inclusions.

\begin{remark}
    Recall that via the functor of points perspective, its objects are pairs $(P,\phi)$, where $P$ is a principal $\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle and $\phi: P\to V$ is $\mathbb{C}^*$-equivariant.

    For a given choice of character $\chi_m$, the semistable locus $V^{ss}(\chi_m)$ is an open subset of $V$. It is open because it is defined by the nonvanishing of some semi-invariant sections. The corresponding GIT quotient is $[V^{ss}(\chi_m)/\mathbb{C}^*]$ as a substack.
Thus:
\[
X_\pm = [V^{ss}(\pm 1)/\mathbb{C}^*] \;\subset\; [V/\mathbb{C}^*] = \mathcal{X}
\]
It turns out that open substacks of quotient stacks $[V/G]$ are exactly those substacks which are of the form $[U/G]$ where $U\subseteq V$ is a $G$-invariant open subscheme. Here $V^{ss}(\chi_m)\subset V$ is $G$-invariant and open, so $[V^{ss}(\chi_m)/\mathbb{C}^*]\hookrightarrow [V/\mathbb{C}^*]$ is exactly an open immersion of stacks.
\end{remark}

This stacky point of view makes it clear that there are (exact) restriction functors
\[
    \iota_{\pm}^* : D^b(\mathcal{X}) \;\to\; D^b(X_{\pm}).
\]

By $D^b(\mathcal{X})$ we mean the derived category of the category of $\mathbb{C}^*$-equivariant sheaves on $V$. This contains the obvious equivariant line bundles $\mathcal{O}(i)$ associated to the characters of $\mathbb{C}^*$.

\begin{remark}[General fact about open immersions]
If $j: U \hookrightarrow X$ is an open immersion of schemes, then there is an exact restriction functor $j^*: \mathrm{QCoh}(X) \to \mathrm{QCoh}(U)$. Exactness comes from the fact that restricting a quasi-coherent sheaf to an open set is just tensoring with $\mathcal{O}_U$, which is flat. Passing to derived categories, you still have $j^*: D^b(\mathrm{QCoh}(X)) \to D^b(\mathrm{QCoh}(U))$. The exact same holds in the stack setting: if $\iota: \mathcal{U} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{X}$ is an open immersion of stacks, you get $\iota^*: D^b(\mathcal{X}) \to D^b(\mathcal{U})$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[General dictionary for quotient stacks and equivariant geometry]
There is a general dictionary relating the stack-theoretic concepts and the equivariant geometry of $X$. Here $G$ is a reductive algebraic group acting on a scheme $X$ and $[X/G]$ is the quotient stack.

The unstable locus for the negative character is the set
$\{y_1 = y_2 = 0\} \subset V$. Consider the \red{Koszul resolution} of the associated sky-scraper sheaf:
\[
K_{-} = \mathcal{O}(2) \xrightarrow{(y_2,-y_1)} \mathcal{O}(1)^{\oplus 2} 
\xrightarrow{(y_1,y_2)} \mathcal{O}.
\]
Then $\iota_{-}K_{-}$ is exact, \red{it is the pull-up of the Euler sequence} from 
$\mathbb{P}^1_{y_1:y_2}$. On the other hand $\iota_{+}K_{-}$ is a resolution of the sky-scraper 
sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1_{x_1:x_2}}$ along the zero section. Similar comments apply for 
the Koszul resolution $K_{+}$ of the set $\{x_1 = x_2 = 0\}$.

Let
\[
\mathcal{G}_t \subset D^b(\mathcal{X})
\]
be the triangulated subcategory generated by the line bundles 
$\mathcal{O}(t)$ and $\mathcal{O}(t+1)$. This is the \textbf{grade restriction rule} of \cite{ref}, 
we are restricting to characters lying in the “window” $[t,t+1]$.

\begin{claim}
For any $t \in \mathbb{Z}$, both $\iota_+^*$ and $\iota_-^*$ restrict to give equivalences
\[
D^b(X_+) \xleftarrow{\sim} \mathcal{G}_t \xrightarrow{\sim} D^b(X_-).
\]
\end{claim}

To see that these functors are fully-faithful it suffices to check what they do to the maps 
between the generating line-bundles, so we just need to check that
\[
\operatorname{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathcal{O}(t+k),\mathcal{O}(t+l))
= \operatorname{Ext}^\bullet_{X_\pm}(\mathcal{O}(t+k),\mathcal{O}(t+l))
\]
for $k,l \in [0,1]$, i.e.
\[
H^\bullet_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathcal{O}(i)) = H^\bullet_{X_\pm}(\mathcal{O}(i))
\]
for $i \in [-1,1]$, and this is \red{easily verified}. To see that they are essentially surjective we need 
to know that the two given line bundles generate $D^b(X_\pm)$. This is essentially a corollary of Beilinson's theorem \cite{beilinson}. One way to see it is to first observe that the set $\{\mathcal{O}(i),\, i\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ generates $D^b(X_\pm)$ because $X_\pm$ is quasi-projective, 
then use twists of the exact sequence $\iota_\pm K_\mp$ repeatedly to resolve any $\mathcal{O}(i)$ 
by a complex involving only $\mathcal{O}(t)$ and $\mathcal{O}(t+1)$.

So for any $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ we have a derived equivalence
\[
\Phi_t : D^b(X_+) \;\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }\; D^b(X_-)
\]
passing through $\mathcal{G}_t$. Composing these, we get auto-equivalences
\[
\Phi_{t+1}^{-1}\Phi_t : D^b(X_+) \;\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }\; D^b(X_+).
\]

To see what these do, we need to check them on the generating set of line-bundles 
$\{\mathcal{O}(t), \mathcal{O}(t+1)\}$. Applying $\Phi_t$ to this set is easy, \red{it just sends them 
to the same line-bundles} on $X_-$. To apply $\Phi_{t+1}^{-1}$ however, we first have to resolve 
$\mathcal{O}(t)$ in terms of $\mathcal{O}(t+1)$ and $\mathcal{O}(t+2)$. We do this using the 
exact sequence $\iota_-K_{-}(t)$. \red{The result is that }$\Phi_{t+1}^{-1}\Phi_t$ sends
\[
\mathcal{O}(t) \;\mapsto\; 
\big[ \mathcal{O}(t+2) \xrightarrow{(-y_2,y_1)} \mathcal{O}(t+1)^{\oplus 2} \big], 
\qquad
\mathcal{O}(t+1) \;\mapsto\; \mathcal{O}(t+1).
\]

\begin{claim}
$\Phi_{t+1}^{-1}\Phi_t$ is an inverse spherical twist around 
$\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1_{x_1:x_2}}(t)$.
\end{claim}

A spherical twist is an autoequivalence discovered by \cite{seidel-thomas} associated to any 
spherical object in the derived category, i.e.\ an object $S$ such that
\[
\operatorname{Ext}(S,S) = \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}[-n]
\]
for some $n$ (i.e.\ the homology of the $n$-sphere). It sends any object $\mathcal{E}$ to the 
\red{cone on the evaluation map}
\[
\big[ \operatorname{RHom}(S,\mathcal{E}) \otimes S \;\longrightarrow\; \mathcal{E} \big].
\]
The inverse twist sends $\mathcal{E}$ to the cone on the dual evaluation map
\[
\big[ \mathcal{E} \;\longrightarrow\; \operatorname{RHom}(\mathcal{E},S)^\vee \otimes S \big].
\]

The object $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1_{x_1:x_2}}(t) \simeq \iota_+K_{-}(t)$ is spherical, and 
the inverse twist around it sends $\mathcal{O}(t+1)$ to itself and $\mathcal{O}(t)$ to the cone
\[
\big[\mathcal{O}(t) \longrightarrow \iota_+K_{-}(t)\big] 
\simeq \big[\mathcal{O}(t+2) \xrightarrow{(-y_2,y_1)} \mathcal{O}(t+1)^{\oplus 2}\big],
\]
which agrees with $\Phi_{t+1}^{-1}\Phi_t$. \red{To complete the proof of the claim we would just need to check that the two functors }also agree on the Hom-sets between $\mathcal{O}(t)$ and 
$\mathcal{O}(t+1)$.

Now instead let $V = \mathbb{C}^{p+q}$ with co-ordinates $x_1,\ldots,x_p, y_1,\ldots,y_q$. 
Let $\mathbb{C}^*$ act linearly on $V$ with positive weights on each $x_i$ and negative weights 
on each $y_i$. The two GIT quotients $X_+$ and $X_-$ are both the total spaces of orbi-vector 
bundles over weighted projective spaces.

We must assume the Calabi–Yau condition that $\mathbb{C}^*$ acts through $SL(V)$. Let $d$ be the 
sum of the positive weights, so the sum of the negative weights is $-d$. The above argument goes 
through word-for-word, where now
\[
\mathcal{G}_t = \langle \mathcal{O}(t), \ldots, \mathcal{O}(t+d-1)\rangle.
\]
