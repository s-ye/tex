My top priority to be to learn this stuff for Teleman. There are these 3 preprints of his student Pablo that he sent me.

Stage 1: Stable Curves and Basic Moduli Theory. 
- Study stable $n$-pointed curves and why the moduli space $M_{g,n}$ is compact.
- Deligne–Mumford compactification. 
- Examples like $M_{0,4}\cong \mathbb{P}^1$ with three points removed, which illustrates adding singular (nodal) curves to compactify.

Stage 2: Stable Maps and Gromov–Witten Theory: 
- Construction of $M_{g,n}(X,\beta)$ ￼
- Focus on the case of genus $0$ first, which is simpler: e.g. $M_{0,n}(P^r,d)$ and how it adds components when a map degenerates (develop intuition with the example of maps $\mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^2$ breaking into multiple components)
- Evaluation maps $ev_i$ and psi classes on $M_{g,n}$ 
- Definition of GW invariants as intersection numbers 
- Calculations: for instance, compute the number of lines through two points in $\mathbb{P}^2$ via $⟨pt, pt⟩{0,1}$, or verify the formula $N_d$ for rational plane curves through $3d-1$ points ￼
- Virtual fundamental classes in an informal way (you might accept on faith that $[M{g,n}(X,\beta)]^{vir}$ exists and allows these integrals). 
- Should be comfortable with terms like “stable map,” “evaluation map,” “descendant invariants,” and the idea that GW invariants can be packaged as a generating function (the potential) or as giving a product on cohomology (quantum product).
